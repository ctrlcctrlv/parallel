    parallel - a command-line CPU load balancer, aka a work-stealer, written in Rust

SYNOPSIS
    parallel [OPTIONS...] 'COMMAND' <MODE INPUTS...>...
    parallel [OPTIONS...] <MODE 'COMMANDS'...>...
    COMMAND | parallel [OPTIONS...] <MODE INPUTS...>...

DESCRIPTION
    Parallel parallelizes otherwise non-parallel command-line tasks. When
    there are a number of commands that need to be executed, which may be
    executed in parallel, the Parallel application will evenly distribute
    tasks to all available CPU cores. There are three basic methods for how
    commands are supplied:

    1. A COMMAND may be defined, followed by a MODE which denotes
       that all following arguments will be used as INPUTS for the command.

    2. If no COMMAND is provided, then the INPUTS will be interpreted as
       COMMANDS.

    3. If no INPUTS are provided, then standard input will be read for INPUTS.

    Parallel groups the standard output and error of each child process so that
    outputs are printed in the order that they are given, as if the tasks were
    executed serially in a traditional for loop. In addition, commands are
    executed in the platform's preferred shell by default, which is `sh -c` on
    Unix systems, and `cmd /C` on Windows. This comes at a performance cost, so
    it can be disabled with the --no-shell option.

INPUT MODES
    Input modes are used to determine whether the following inputs are files
    that contain inputs or inputs themselves. Files with inputs have each
    input stored on a separate line, and each line is considered an entire
    input. When there are multiple collected lists of inputs, each individual
    input list will be permutated together into a single list.

    :::
        Denotes that the input arguments that follow are input arguments.
        Additionally, those arguments will be collected into a new list.

    :::+
        Denotes that the input arguments that follow are input arguments.
        Additionally, those arguments will be added to the current list.

    ::::
        Denotes that the input arguments that follow are files with inputs.
        Additionally, those arguments will be collected into a new list.

    ::::+
        Denotes that the input arguments that follow are files with inputs.
        Additionally, those arguments will be added to the current list.

INPUT TOKENS
    COMMANDs are typically formed the same way that you would normally in the
    shell, only that you will replace your input arguments with placeholder
    tokens like {}, {.}, {/}, {//} and {/.}. If no tokens are provided, it is
    inferred that the final argument in the command will be {}. These tokens
    will perform text manipulation on the inputs to mangle them in the way you
    like. Ideas for more tokens are welcome.

    -          {}: Will supply the input argument untouched.
    -         {.}: Removes the extension from the input.
    -   {^abc...}: Removes a custom suffix from the input.
    -         {/}: Displays the base name (file name) of the input.
    -        {//}: Displays the directory name of the input.
    -        {/.}: Displays the base name with the extension removed.
    -  {/^abc...}: Displays the base name with a custom suffix removed.
    -         {#}: Displays the current job ID as a number counting from 1.
    -        {##}: Displays the total number of jobs to be processed.
    -         {%}: Displays the thread's ID number.
    -         {N}: Where N is a number, display the associated job number.
    -        {N.}: Removes the extension from the Nth job.
    -        {N/}: Displays the base name (file name) of the Nth job.
    -  {N^abc...}: Removes a custom suffix from the Nth job.
    -       {N//}: Displays the directory name of the Nth job.
    -       {N/.}: Displays the base name of the Nth job with the extension removed.
    - {N/^abc...}: Displays the base name of the Nth job with a custom suffix removed.


OPTIONS
    Options may also be supplied to the program to change how the program
    operates:

    --delay:
        Delays starting the next job for N amount of seconds, where the seconds can be fractional.

    --dry-run:
        Prints the jobs that will be run to standard output, without running them.

    --eta:
        Prints the estimated time to complete based on average runtime of running processes.

    -j, --jobs:
        Defines the number of tasks to process in parallel.
        Values may be written as a number (12) or as a percent (150%).
        The default value is the number of CPU cores in the system.

    --joblog:
        Logs job statistics to a designated file as they are completed.

    --joblog-8601:
        Writes the start time in the ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`

    --memfree:
        Defines the minimum amount of memory available before starting the next job.

    -n, --max-args:
        Groups up to a certain number of arguments together in the same
        command line. For example, if five arguments are supplied and max
        args is set to `2`, then arguments one and two will become the
        first argument, arguments three and four will become the second
        argument, and argument five will become the third argument.

    --num-cpu-cores:
        A convenience command that will print the number of CPU cores in the system.

    -p, --pipe:
        Instead of supplying arguments as arguments to child processes, apply
        them to the standard input of each child process.

    -q, --quote:
        Escapes the command argument supplied so that spaces, quotes, and slashes
        are retained.

    -s, --silent, --quiet:
        Disables printing the standard output of running processes.

    --shebang:
        Grants ability to utilize the parallel command as an interpreter via
        calling it within a shebang line.

    --shellquote:
        Prints commands that will be executed, with the commands quoted.

    --tmpdir:
        Defines the directory to use for temporary files.

    --timeout:
        If a command runs for longer than a specified number of seconds, it will be
        killed with a SIGKILL.

    -v, --verbose:
        Print information about running processes.

    --version:
        Print version information.

EXAMPLES
    # Command followed by inputs
    parallel -vun 'ffmpeg -i "{}" -c:a libopus -b:a 128k "{.}.opus"' ::: $(find -type f -name "*.flac")

    # Reading from Stdin
    find -type f -name "*.flac" | parallel -vun 'ffmpeg -i "{}" -c:a libopus -b:a 128k "{.}.opus"'

    # Inputs are used as commands
    parallel ::: "echo 1" "echo 2" "echo 3" "echo 4"

    # Placeholder values automatically inferred
    parallel -j2 wget ::: URL1 URL2 URL3 URL4

    # Reading inputs from files and command arguments
    parallel 'echo {}' :::: list1 list2 ::: $(seq 1 10) :::: list3 list4

    # Within a file, with each successive newline being an input argument
    #!/usr/bin/parallel --shebang echo

HOW IT WORKS
    The Parallel command consists of three phases: parsing, threading, and execution.

    1. Parsing Phase
        A. Arguments are read into a write-only in-memory disk buffer which
           stores inputs into an unprocessed file when the disk buffer is full.

        B. Flags are parsed from the command-line along with the command
           argument.

        C. The command argument is tokenized into primitives that serve as
           placeholders for the input arguments.

        D. An input iterator is created that buffers arguments from the
           unprocessed file into an in-memory read-only disk buffer.

    2. Threading Phase
        A. An atomic reference-counted mutex of the input iterator is created
           and shared among all of the threads.

        B. Threads are created for each of the cores that will be processing.

        C. Threads read from the input iterator as soon as they finish a task
           and begin to process the next task.

    3. Execution Phase
        A. Each thread will generate commands by replacing command tokens with
           the current input argument being processed.

        B. Commands are then executed in a sub-process, with their standard
           output and error piped to the main process.

        C. Messages from processes are sorted and printed in the order that
           inputs were given, as if each command was executed serially.

        D. When processes complete, they are written to the processed file.

        E. Once all processes have been completed, the program exits.
